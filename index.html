        Hello! My name is Ashley Wong. I am a rising Sophomore in a high school
        in New York, and part of both the fencing team and the robotics team in
        my school. I love to spend times with my friends and family, despite
        quarantine. I've been interested in the STEM field since the 7th grade
        and I was excited to be part of a robotics team once I go to high
        school. My friend told me about Girls Who Code and told me about SIP, so
        I signed up and got offered a spot :D. I hope to learn more through
        Girls Who Code SIP this week. (✿◠‿◠)
