        Hello! My name is Ashley Wong. I am a rising Sophomore in a high school
        in New York, and part of both the fencing team and the robotics team in
        my school. I love to spend times with my friends and family, despite
        quarantine (✿◠‿◠) My hobbies are photography, drawing, playing video
        games, and watching a lot of anime!(✿ ♥‿♥) This is the first website I
        have coded, so I hope I did well! :D
